Simple Arduino program to drive a solenoid actuator so you can bounce your phone and generate step data in Pokemon Go.

## Necessary Hardware
- [Arduino Uno](https://www.amazon.com/RoboGets-Compatible-ATmega328P-Microcontroller-Electronics/dp/B01N4LP86I/ref=sr_1_1_sspa)
- [Solenoid Actuator](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MRDHWGY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00)
- [L298N H-bridge Driver](https://www.amazon.com/Qunqi-Controller-Module-Stepper-Arduino/dp/B014KMHSW6/ref=sr_1_1_sspa)
- [12V Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/R-Tech-UL-Listed-Switching-Supply-Adapter/dp/B00FEOB4EI/ref=sr_1_3)
- Jumper Wires and Breadboard

I will update this readme in the future with more details about wiring. For now, the source code should be sufficient to make the connections. I will also upload a version of the code that does not have the binary input option enabled. This will greatly simplify wiring.
